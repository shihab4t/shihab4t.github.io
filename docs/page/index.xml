        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m Shihab Mahamud, I am doing a diploma in engineering at Faridpur Polytechnic Institute and my major is in Computer Technology. I enjoy coding in C/C++. I also love problem-solving and I do it every day. C was the first programming language I taught myself. Later I tried many different things: C++, Python, Java. And many related frameworks and technologies. I’ve taught myself some basic CS topics in the way as well. I’ve solved 500+ Algorithmic problems in various online judges. For now, I’m focused on Competitive Programming and Backend-Engineering Also I love new technologies and I love to learn new technologies. Some of the other things that fascinate me are Islamic Study, History, books, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
